OVERVIEW :
DipanshuToken, which is an ERC20-like token written using Solidity is a very basic example. 
For instance, it has functionalities like producing new tokens as well as destroying them.
However, this does not comply entirely with the ERC20 standard established to comprehensively manage tokens within the Ethereum network.

Token Details:
Token Name: CHANDIGARHMETA
Token Symbol: CUMT
Compiler Version: >=0.6.12 <0.9.0

Features:
The contract includes the following features:

Public Variables:

tokenName: The name of the token.
tokenAbbrv: The abbreviation or symbol of the token.
totalIntake: The total supply of tokens minted.
Mapping:

remainder: A mapping that keeps track of each address's token balance.
Mint Function:

mint(address add, uint _value): Mints new tokens to the specified address.
Increases the totalIntake by _value.
Increases the balance of add by _value.
Burn Function:

burn(address add, uint _value): Burns tokens from the specified address.
Decreases the totalIntake by _value if the balance of add is greater than or equal to _value.
Decreases the balance of add by _value.

Deployment:
To deploy the contract, use a Solidity compiler (like Remix) and follow these steps:

Open the Solidity file in Remix or any other Solidity IDE.
Select the appropriate compiler version (>=0.6.12 <0.9.0).
Compile the contract.
Deploy the contract to your preferred Ethereum network.

Usage:
After deployment, you can interact with the contract using the following functions:

mint(address add, uint _value): Mint _value tokens to the address add.
burn(address add, uint _value): Burn _value tokens from the address add.
